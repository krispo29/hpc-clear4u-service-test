# MAWB System Integration - Database Migration Summary

## Task Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the completion of Task 1: "Set up database schema and migrations" from the MAWB System Integration specification.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Migration Files Created

- `001_create_cargo_manifest_tables.sql` - Creates cargo manifest tables
- `002_create_draft_mawb_tables.sql` - Creates draft MAWB tables
- `003_rollback_mawb_system_integration.sql` - Rollback migration (excluded from normal runs)

### 2. Migration Infrastructure

- `database/migrations.go` - Migration runner with transaction support
- `cmd/migrate/main.go` - CLI tool to run migrations
- `cmd/verify-schema/main.go` - Schema verification tool
- `cmd/clear-migrations/main.go` - Utility to reset migration state
- `migrate.bat` - Windows batch file for easy migration execution
- `Makefile` - Added `make migrate` target

### 3. Database Tables Created

#### Cargo Manifest Tables

- **cargo_manifest** - Main cargo manifest table

  - UUID primary key
  - Foreign key to `tbl_mawb_info(uuid)` with CASCADE DELETE
  - Status field with check constraint
  - Automatic timestamp management

- **cargo_manifest_items** - Cargo manifest items
  - Serial ID primary key
  - Foreign key to `cargo_manifest(uuid)` with CASCADE DELETE

#### Draft MAWB Tables

- **draft_mawb** - Main draft MAWB table

  - UUID primary key
  - Foreign key to `tbl_mawb_info(uuid)` with CASCADE DELETE
  - 40+ fields for comprehensive MAWB data
  - Status field with check constraint
  - Automatic timestamp management

- **draft_mawb_items** - Draft MAWB items

  - Serial ID primary key
  - Foreign key to `draft_mawb(uuid)` with CASCADE DELETE
  - Calculation fields for volume, weight, charges

- **draft_mawb_item_dims** - Item dimensions

  - Serial ID primary key
  - Foreign key to `draft_mawb_items(id)` with CASCADE DELETE
  - Length, width, height, count fields

- **draft_mawb_charges** - MAWB charges
  - Serial ID primary key
  - Foreign key to `draft_mawb(uuid)` with CASCADE DELETE
  - Key-value structure for flexible charge types

### 4. Database Features Implemented

#### Foreign Key Constraints (6 total)

✅ All foreign keys implemented with CASCADE DELETE:

- cargo_manifest → tbl_mawb_info
- cargo_manifest_items → cargo_manifest
- draft_mawb → tbl_mawb_info
- draft_mawb_items → draft_mawb
- draft_mawb_item_dims → draft_mawb_items
- draft_mawb_charges → draft_mawb

#### Performance Indexes (8 total)

✅ Indexes created on:

- Foreign key columns for JOIN performance
- Status fields for filtering queries
- Created_at fields for date-based queries

#### Data Integrity Features

✅ Check constraints for status fields ('Draft', 'Pending', 'Confirmed', 'Rejected')
✅ Automatic timestamp triggers for updated_at fields
✅ UUID primary keys with automatic generation
✅ NOT NULL constraints on required fields

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the task specification:

- **6.1** ✅ CASCADE DELETE relationships when MAWB Info records are deleted
- **6.2** ✅ CASCADE DELETE for cargo manifest and related items
- **6.3** ✅ CASCADE DELETE for draft MAWB and related items, dimensions, and charges
- **6.4** ✅ CASCADE DELETE for draft MAWB items and related dimensions
- **6.5** ✅ Foreign key constraint validation and error handling

## Verification Results

Schema verification confirms:

- ✅ All 7 tables created successfully
- ✅ All 6 foreign key constraints in place
- ✅ Migration tracking system working
- ✅ Rollback capability available

## Usage Instructions

### Run Migrations

```bash
# Using Go
go run cmd/migrate/main.go

# Using Make (Linux/Mac)
make migrate

# Using Windows batch file
migrate.bat
```

### Verify Schema

```bash
go run cmd/verify-schema/main.go
```

### Reset Migrations (Development Only)

```bash
go run cmd/clear-migrations/main.go
```

## Next Steps

With the database schema successfully implemented, the next tasks in the implementation plan can proceed:

- Task 2.1: Implement Cargo Manifest core data structures
- Task 2.2: Create Cargo Manifest repository interface and implementation
- Task 2.3: Implement Cargo Manifest service layer

The database foundation is now ready to support the full MAWB System Integration feature implementation.
